# SQL_UFC
An advanced SQL database project showcasing comprehensive analytics and data management techniques applied to UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) data.


# Final Project in Advanced SQL Database Analytics: UFC Data Management and Analysis System

This project is the culminating work for the Advanced SQL Database Analytics course, where we implemented a comprehensive system for managing and analyzing data from the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) organization using SQL.

## What the Project Included:

1. **Planning and Specification**: 
   - We performed an in-depth specification of the UFC data system.
   - We created a detailed diagram of the database structure, including tables for fighters, fights, events, weight categories, and more.

2. **Database Setup**: 
   - We created an SQL script to set up the complete UFC database.
   - We defined tables, primary and foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity.

3. **Creating VIEWS**: 
   - We developed several VIEWS for advanced analysis, such as:
     - Fighter rankings based on performance
     - Cumulative statistics for each fighter
     - Analysis of trends in fighting styles over time

4. **Writing Stored Procedures**: 
   - We created complex procedures, for example:
     - Updating fighter rankings after each fight
     - Analyzing a fighter's performance against specific opponents
   - We used input and output parameters and temporary tables to return results.

5. **Developing Functions**: 
   - We wrote scalar and table-valued functions, such as:
     - Calculating a fighter's score based on performance
     - Statistical analysis of effective fighting styles

6. **Implementing Triggers and Transactions**: 
   - We created triggers for automatically updating fighter statistics after a fight.
   - We used transactions to manage complex updates, like moving a fighter to a different weight category.

7. **Excel Integration**: 
   - We developed a mechanism for importing new fight data from Excel.
   - We created a system for exporting detailed statistical reports to Excel.

8. **Backup and Restore System**: 
   - We implemented automatic backup processes for the database.
   - We created a procedure for data restoration in case of failure.

9. **Using Window Functions**: 
   - We used window functions to analyze trends, such as:
     - Tracking improvement in fighter performance over time
     - Analyzing changes in the popularity of fighting styles between seasons

10. **Comprehensive Documentation**: 
    - We wrote detailed documentation for every part of the system, including explanations of the business and technical logic.

The project demonstrated comprehensive use of advanced SQL tools for managing and analyzing complex data from a professional sports organization. We implemented advanced analytical solutions using a variety of tools learned in the course, tailored to the unique needs of UFC data analysis.
